# Pigeons

Welcome to the Unnofical Don't Feed The Pigeons.

[Josie](https://twitter.com/josiebellini) has gone above and beyond to be generous with us, and decided to gift us **100** day reveal.

Our community is so excited about this drop and so I thought of documenting how the 100 days unfold.

In one of the community announcements, it was stated that our dear artist, *Josie*, will not ping us daily, (secretly) wish she actually pinged us every time the transaction was sent to the contract.


## Rules Of The Play

- There exists 500 total artworks in this collection.
- For the next 100 days a transaction will be submitted to this smart contract.
- Which shall pick 5 *token IDs* (from 1..to..500) randomly.
- The solidity code will also pick which of the **12** color-ways are assigned to earlier picked token IDs.
- Also there is a chance, for those token ID(s) to win addional prize.


## Prizes
- 16/500 token IDs will be the luck winners.
